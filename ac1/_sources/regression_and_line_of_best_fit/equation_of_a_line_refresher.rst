Equation of a Line (Refresher)
==============================

  :alt: Slope intercept form: y equals m times x plus b.

All line equations in this text will be presented in the form y = m*x + b, where
m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. The **y-intercept** is the y-value at
the point where the line crosses the y-axis. The :ref:`slope <interpreting-slope>` 
gives the steepness of the line, and can be positive, negative, or zero.
